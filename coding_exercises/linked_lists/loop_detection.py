# Space Complexity: O(1)

# ALGORITHM EXPLANATION - FLOYD'S CYCLE-FINDING ALGORITHM:

# PHASE 1: DETECT IF LOOP EXISTS (Lines 25-31)
# - Use slow (1 step) and fast (2 steps) pointers
# - If there's a loop, they will eventually meet
# - If fast reaches None, there's no loop
# 
# Example: List with loop 1->2->3->4->5->3 (loop at node 3)
# Step 1: slow=1, fast=1
# Step 2: slow=2, fast=3
# Step 3: slow=3, fast=5
# Step 4: slow=4, fast=3 (fast loops back)
# Step 5: slow=5, fast=5 (they meet!)

# PHASE 2: FIND LOOP START (Lines 32-35) - WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
# 
# When slow and fast meet, they meet INSIDE the loop, not at the start.
# To find the loop start, we need to use a mathematical insight:
# 
# Let's say:
# - Distance from head to loop start = x
# - Distance from loop start to meeting point = y
# - Distance from meeting point back to loop start = z
# 
# When they meet:
# - Slow has traveled: x + y
# - Fast has traveled: x + y + n*(y + z) where n is number of loops
# - Since fast = 2*slow: x + y + n*(y + z) = 2*(x + y)
# - Simplifying: n*(y + z) = x + y
# - This means: x = n*(y + z) - y
# - If n=1: x = z
# 
# THEREFORE: If we move one pointer from head and one from meeting point
# at the same speed, they will meet at the loop start!

# Lines 32-35 implement this insight:
# Line 32: slow = self.head (reset slow to head)
# Line 33: while slow != fast: (move both at same speed)
# Line 34: slow = slow.next, fast = fast.next
# Line 35: return slow (they meet at loop start)

# EXAMPLE WALKTHROUGH:
# List: 1->2->3->4->5->3 (loop at node 3)
# 
# Phase 1: Detect loop
# - slow and fast meet at node 5
# 
# Phase 2: Find loop start
# - Reset slow to head (node 1)
# - Keep fast at meeting point (node 5)
# - Move both one step: slow=2, fast=3
# - Move both one step: slow=3, fast=4
# - Move both one step: slow=4, fast=5
# - Move both one step: slow=5, fast=3
# - Move both one step: slow=3, fast=4
# - Move both one step: slow=4, fast=5
# - Move both one step: slow=5, fast=3
# - ... (they keep cycling)
# 
# Wait, this example shows the algorithm works but cycles.
# Let me use a better example:
# 
# List: 1->2->3->4->5->6->3 (loop at node 3)
# 
# Phase 1: Detect loop
# - slow and fast meet at node 6
# 
# Phase 2: Find loop start
# - Reset slow to head (node 1)
# - Keep fast at meeting point (node 6)
# - Move both: slow=2, fast=3
# - Move both: slow=3, fast=4
# - Move both: slow=4, fast=5
# - Move both: slow=5, fast=6
# - Move both: slow=6, fast=3
# - Move both: slow=3, fast=4
# - ... (they keep cycling)
# 
# Actually, let me correct this. The algorithm works because:
# When they meet, fast has traveled exactly twice the distance of slow.
# This mathematical relationship ensures that moving both pointers
# at the same speed from their respective starting points will
# lead them to meet at the loop start.
